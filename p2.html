			<h1>Welcome to Light City</h1>
			<p>Light City is a megalopolis thriving in the middle of a wasteland left by nuclear war of ages past.
				<br/>While the gritty streets seem inhospitable, they're a far better place to live in than the regions beyond the city.
				<br/>Still, that doesn't mean it's safe. Crime is frequent, average quality of life remains low, and the corporations aren't too kind either.
				<br/>Good luck out there. You'll probably need it.</p>
			<h1>How do I survive and Not Dieâ„¢?</h1>
			<p>Bring a gun. Keep your wits about you, pick up anything that might seem useful, and pray you land enough critical hits.</p>
			<h1>Okay, but how do I actually play the game?</h1>
			<p>You'll be presented with three options at all times. Selecting one is as simple as clicking on it.
				<br/>You can see your current status on the bottom of the screen. If your Health reaches zero, you die. Obviously.
				<br/>Your Attack determines how hard you hit, your Defence determines how much damage you resist.
				<br/>Critical hits are random for now. Chances should be around 10-15%.</p>
