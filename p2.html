			<h2>Welcome to Alicante</h2>
			<p>Alicante is a megalopolis thriving in the middle of a wasteland left by nuclear war of ages past.
				<br/>While the gritty streets seem inhospitable, they're a far better place to live in than the regions beyond the city.
				<br/>Still, that doesn't mean it's safe. Crime is frequent, average quality of life remains low, and the corporations aren't too kind either.
				<br/>Good luck out there. You'll probably need it.</p>
			<h2>How do I survive and Not Dieâ„¢?</h2>
			<p>Bring a gun. Keep your wits about you, be aware of everything around you and pray you land enough critical hits.</p>
			<h2>Okay, but how do I actually play the game?</h2>
			<p>You'll be presented with up to three options at all times. Selecting one is as simple as clicking on it.
				<br/>You can see your current status on the bottom of the screen. If your Health reaches zero, you die. Obviously.
				<br/>Your Attack determines how hard you hit, your Defence determines how much damage you resist.
				<br/>Critical hits are random for now. Chances should be around 10-15%.</p>
			<h2>What data does this game collect?</h2>
			<p>None that I know of. However, the game creates a save file with your current progress and stores it locally on your browser using the WebStorage API.
				<br/>You can delete this file at any time with the Clear Data button on the bottom of the in-game UI.
				<br/>The only cookies used are considered Strictly Functional - If the browser/page doesn't create it by default, it's not there.
				<br/>However, full disclosure: This game is hosted with Github Pages. While Github Pages does not collect user data or store cookies, this is still worth mentioning for transparency.
				<br/>To the best of my knowledge, cookies are not used. None of this site's code includes any use of cookies.</p>
