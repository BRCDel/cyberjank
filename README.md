#Cyberjank 2067

The aim of this page is to offer a silly text-based adventure game in the form of a parody of "Cyberpunk 2077" by Polish developer CD Projekt Red.

While Cyberpunk itself is an ambitious title made by a strong development team, its launch and current condition can only be described as "bumpy".

This is not an attempt to insult, demean or otherwise aim any form of negativity at CDPR and/or Cyberpunk and/or any other entity or product related to CDPR - obviously.

This is merely a parody made for fun. Its point is to entertain and nothing else.
